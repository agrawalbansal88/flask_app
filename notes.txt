Flask is having mainly 2 components
1. Jinja 2 (for template)
2. Werkzeug  (HTTP and routing)

3. development server and debugger
4. unit testing support

it usage Model-template-view pattern


export FLASK_APP=flashcards.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
http://127.0.0.1:5000/


pip3 install -r requirement.txt
sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
gunicorn3 -D flashcards:app

-D option is for run in background
gunicorn runs on port 8000 on non-root users. but external world sends request on port 80. either run as root user or use ngnix. running as root user is bad as its not safe.

ngnix:
it can listen in port 80 and send request to gunicorn on 8000
also it guard server from "denial of service" attack


----
cd /etc/ngnix/static-avialable/
replace default file code with below code.
https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html

sudo service ngnix restart

----


app.run(port=5000)

for REST, we should have "
response= Response("", 201, mimetype="application/json")
response.header['Location'] = "/books/" + str(new_book[isbn]) ----- location of newly created object
return response
